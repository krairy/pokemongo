# Is my Pokemon of any use in PvP?

Popular resourses like Gamepress and PvPoke are great but have certain disadvantages. This search tool returns raitings of a pokemon in every league at once, including Halloween and Little jungle cups. Thus you know whether to collect this species - easily look it up it right in the field!

Simply open the Jupyter notebook file (.ipynb) and click on the orange "Open in collab" button. 

Follow the instructions inside the Notebook. Run (with the "play" button on the left) the first and the second pieces of code; enter the name of your Pokemon and hit Enter (case insensetive). 
If you want to search again, you have to run the second cell again. 

The Pokemon database is taken from [PvPoke](https://pvpoke.com/rankings/) on 07 Sep 2021.
